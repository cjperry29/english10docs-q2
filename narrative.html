        1. We used Photo 5 because it looked the most eerie
        and it gave them creepy vibes off.

       2. It was 12:30 and I was going to get my midnight snack and I heard a thump at the basement stairs
        and I went look and saw a girl walking up the stairs with a demented, obscured, gnome mask on 
        with long hair. As the moonlight shines through the windows on the stairs I felt a cold gust of 
        wind go through my body and the girl sped up and started clawing at my ankles as I ran from her. 
        There was muffled screaming coming from her mask, and had foam leaking out of it. My brother came 
        out of his room as I ran past it, he came out to see what all the noise was and she sliced his 
        foot open with her nails. Then, I ran ahead and got out of my house and ran as far away as I 
        could. I never saw anyone in my family again. Then I woke up.

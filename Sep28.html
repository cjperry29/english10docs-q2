I like to play Baseball but I do have some bad memories about the sport. Last year I was practicing pitching with my friend at
our neighborhood park and I was pitching, he was hitting and when he hit the ball it came right back at me and hit me in the face
because I did not have enough time to react. Another time, I was watch my brother play a game and one of the players from another field 
hit a foul ball and I did not look up because I thought it went in the other direction from me but it did not and it almost hit me on the head.

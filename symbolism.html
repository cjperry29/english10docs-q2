<header><h1>Symbolism Notes</h1></header>

<p>A symbol is often an event, object, person or animal to which an extraordinary meaning or significance has been attached.</p>

<p>Symbols can be inherited or invented.</p>

<p>Symbols allow writers to suggest layers of meanings and possibilities that a simple literal statement could not convey as well.</p>
    <p>Symbols allow writers to convey an idea with layers of meaning without having to explain those layers in the text.</p>
    <p>A symbol is like a pebble cast into a pond: It sends out ever widening ripples.</p>
    <p>Pair/Share: Tell your partner a symbol from one of our readings this year or last year.</p>

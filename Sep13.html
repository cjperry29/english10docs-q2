Over the weekend I went to New Jersey to visit my grandparents and aunt and uncle. We left Saturday
morning and came back Sunday night. This was the first time I have seen them since the Summer of 2020.
When we got there we had to put a fridge that we wanted to take home from them in the back of our car, which took awhile.
Then we ate dinner and went to eat ice cream.

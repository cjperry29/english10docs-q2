                underneath the room where the murder took place. At ten minutes after twelve on the night of the killing he
                heard loud noises in the upstairs apartment. He said it sounded like a fight. Then he heard the kid say to his
                father, "I'm gonna kill you.!” A second later he heard a body falling, and he ran to the door of his apartment,
                looked out, and saw the kid running down the stairs and out of the house. Then he called the police. They found
                the father with a knife in his chest."</td>
            <td>Ethos is used because three is saying that the old man is a credible source because he claims he saw the man fall and the boy run. He also heard the boy scream, if the scream sounded like the boys voice then that is also credible.</td>

            <td>Four explains that children who come out of the slums are bad kids, he says they all know it. This would make it credible to help prove he commited the murder. He says that the slums are breeding grounds for criminals implying that there is a good chance the boy is one too.</td>

                FIVE: Too many of them. On my stoop. In my backyard... You don't use this kind of knife that way. You have to hold it like this to release the blade. In order to stab downward, you would have to change your grip."
            </td>
            <td>Five is using ethos because he says he has seen many knife fights in his life so he would know how a switchknife is used. If Five said you had to hold the knife at a different grip then he could be right because he might of seen it be used like that before.</td>

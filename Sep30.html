A few times a month when I am sleeping I will have a dream , or something of a dream, where I will wake up and feel
normal but I can not move and someone will be in my room. This has happened to me a lot over the past few years and
I think that it is not a dream, I am just waking up and I cant move but I am imagining the person there.

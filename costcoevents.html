<p><strong>Source of Article (where is it from?):</strong> The Costco Connection &nbsp; <strong>Date of Article:</strong> October 2017</p>
<p><strong>Title of Article:</strong> Informed Debate</p>
<p><strong>Writer:</strong> Haider Warrich / Paul Root Wolpe</p>

<p><strong>Summarize the article (5-6 sentences minimum):</strong>
Haider Warraich thinks that people having a longer lifespan is good because than they are able to spread their knowledge and learn more about the profession they are in. He says it gives them more time to develop skills and share them with others. If we research it enough then older lives may be possible, and better. Paul Wolpe says that having longer life span is not a good thing because many people, while they might say they want to, will not want to live a long life because if they end up living to 200 they don't want to work for 150 years and if they retire they will get bored fast.

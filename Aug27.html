        <p>The picture looks like it has 3 girls in it, and they are laughing which means they might be friends. They are also sitting near 
            some flowers which could mean it might be summer. They could be laughing at a joke or talking about something funny. The girl with 
            the red striped shift is holding the girl with the black jackets leg and the girl with the black jacket is holding her arm which means 
            they might be dating. They are all dressed like they would be for school so they might have just left school.</p>

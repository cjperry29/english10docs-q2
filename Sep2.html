    <p>Fear is something that is influenced by horror. Horror is mainly when you are caught off-guard by something that looks or sounds scary to you, this could be a face or 
        a scream. Everyone has a different fear level so when one person might fear one thing another person might not. I like some horror movies, the earliest I can recall seeing 
        something scary in entertainment was probably on Halloween when I was young. Some people may have fun with fear, walking through a graveyard at night could be cool to some people 
        while others might get freaked out. Watching a scary movie before you go to bed, somebody might not be able to fall asleep after seeing a movie before they go to bed.</p>
